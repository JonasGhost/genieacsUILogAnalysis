# genieacsUILogAnalysis

Goal of this script is, to show which user uses the ACS service.

It only works with the json Log Format. It parses the logs from genieacs UI and then creates a json output.
Copy all your genieacs ui logfiles uncompressed in the data folder and then run the index.js script.
